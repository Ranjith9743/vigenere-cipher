# Vigenere Cipher

This project is a Python implementation of the **Vigenere Cipher**, a classical method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

## Features
- Encrypt plaintext using a keyword
- Decrypt ciphertext using the same keyword
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ranjith9743/vigenere-cipher.git
